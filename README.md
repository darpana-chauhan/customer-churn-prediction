# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

A complete **Customer Churn Prediction** project built using **Machine Learning** and deployed with **Streamlit**.  
This project helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) so that proactive retention strategies can be applied.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project uses historical customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

The final output is an **interactive web application** where users can enter customer details and instantly get churn prediction results.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Telecom companies face revenue loss due to customer churn.  
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can:
- Identify customers who are likely to churn
- Help businesses take preventive actions
- Improve customer retention and profitability

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Collection (Telecom Customer Dataset)
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection & Encoding
5. Model Training (Classification Algorithm)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Serialization using Pickle (`.pkl`)
8. Deployment using **Streamlit**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pickle**
- **Git & GitHub**
